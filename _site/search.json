Upload a csv and add some parameters and it will give return model validation outputs, graphs, and new tables with REBL scores to download. The app uses the Rhino framework for full-featured Shiny production.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nSustainability Metrics\n\n  \n    \n      \n      SMdata is a repository that contains data collection and cleaning for the FSRI Sustainability Metrics project. Most of the wrangling is in R, but geospatial processing is handled in Python. It is also available as an R package, which makes it easy to get access to datasets as well as convenience functions for working with the metrics.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      SMdocs is a website that contains figures and analyses for the Sustainability Metrics project. It includes a description of the indicator selection processes, various figures describing the indicator framework, as well as analyses at the national and regional levels. It is made with Quarto.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      SMexplorer is a Shiny app that explores food system sustainability data in the Northeast. It includes an interactive map, a metric comparison page, a county details dashboard, as well as a metadata table. It uses the Golem production-grade Shiny applications.\n    \n  \n\n\n\nGrade Calculator\n\n  \n    \n      The Grade Calculator is a Shiny app to make life easier for TAs, specifically in CDAE 1020: World Food, Population, and Development. It takes a csv of grades and returns interactive graphs, summary statistics, and statistical tests to compare grades across cohorts.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nProjector\n\n  \n    \n      The Projector package is a collection of functions for setting up an R project for data analysis. It includes some project setup tools for file structures and the \".Rprofile\" script as well as convenience functions for data wrangling.\n    \n  \n\n\n\nAgConnect\nWork in progress"
