  abstract = {Coffea arabica is a globally significant crop that benefits from pollination by bees. Coffee is an essential crop in Costa Rica, but market forces and climate change are increasing pressure on small farmers, making bee pollination services even more important. However, the rarity of regional and national surveys of pollinators in Costa Rica make it difficult to understand their distributions and conserve bees populations on a large scale. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive field study to better understand the factors shaping coffee pollinator communities across the country.  We surveyed 140 sites across five coffee regions in Costa Rica and analyzed environmental and management factors as potential drivers of pollinator diversity and composition. Across all regions, we identified 58 bee species from nine tribes and three families. We found differences in abundance and richness among regions. Spring precipitation was significantly associated with pollinator richness, and shade had a marginal effect on abundance. We found no significant differences in community composition among regions. However, we identified some species, including Bombus ephippiatus and Nannotrigona perilampoides, that were indicator species for certain regions.  Despite the economic and cultural importance of coffee, this is the first nation-wide study of coffee pollinator communities in Costa Rica. Findings from this study could help coffee farmers identify and manage bee habitat to the benefit of both farmers and pollinators, including protecting nesting habitat and adopting shaded coffee agroecosystems.},

  abstract = {Understanding the motivations and barriers to pro-environmental behavior is essential in mitigating climate change. Extreme weather events may act as focusing events that disrupt routines and encourage pro-environmental behavior, but the inability to reliably measure behavior makes it challenging to study. We used two representative surveys of US residents to administer the REBL Scale, a unidimensional and invariant measure of short-term, pro-environmental behavior. We used factor analytic models to investigate whether experience with extreme weather events influenced REBL scores, either directly or indirectly, as well as whether the effect was mediated or moderated by psychological distance to climate change and attribution of weather events to climate change, respectively. Experience with extreme weather events had both significant direct and indirect effects on REBL scores. Respondents who reported being affected by extreme weather were more likely to have performed pro-environmental behaviors in the last week. Psychological distance was a significant mediator of the indirect effect, which was stronger than the direct effect. The moderating effect of attribution of events to climate change was ambiguous; two methods of latent moderation produced conflicting results. The results suggest that experiences with extreme weather may influence behavior even while controlling for political preferences. Psychological distance could be an important factor in designing behavioral interventions. The moderating effect of attribution deserves further research, as do the latent moderation methods we use to study interactions.},

  abstract = {The field of environmental behavior suffers from a lack of precise, reliable, and unidimensional measurement tools. Without tools that can measure changes over time, the drivers of behavior will remain opaque. To fill this critical gap in the methodological toolkit, we present a new Rasch-model based measurement tool. The Repeated Environmental Behaviors Latent (REBL) Scale contains 24 yes-or-no questions about behaviors carried out over the past week that are transformed into the REBL Score, a true-interval measure that captures a wide range of intensity of pro-environmental behavior preferences. Starting with a broad list of behaviors, we systematically reduced the scale using data from a series of nationally representative surveys to create a measure that is unidimensional, invariant, and reliable. We validate the scale against donations to a pro-environmental non-profit. We also provide open-source online tools to help researchers utilize the scale in research and applied settings.},
